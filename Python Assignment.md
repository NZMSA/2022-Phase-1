# MSA 2022 Python Assignment

By now, you should be familiar with Jupyter notebooks and writing basic Python code. Here's a little project to help you consolidate the skills you've learned from the MS Learn Python modules.

To complete this project, use a Jupyter notebook as well as a virtual environment so that you don't mess up other Python versions you might have on your system.

## Story
You're a crew member on the International Space Station (ISS), doing experiments and generally minding your own business when suddenly, radio antennae on the ISS start picking up a stream of data being transmitted from a galaxy far, far away.

- csv with mix of symbols, letters, and numbers
- parse through and get all numbers and letters
- add numbers up and get co-ordinates
- parse another csv file and convert into dict
- get keys of dict whose values match co-ordinates
- get letters from first csv file and combine them into a string
- string is an instruction e.g. first letter of first key, second letter of second key etc
- find letters within keys that match instruction
- sort them to spell out a word
- **FIRST XX PEOPLE WHO DM THE WORD TO AN MSP AND THEIR NOTEBOOK WIN A PRIZE?!**
- extra maybe: use exception to keep doing something in a loop
