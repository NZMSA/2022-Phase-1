# MSA Phase 1 2022

## Welcome Students

Welcome to the first phase of the Microsoft Student Accelerator for 2022! This is a short overview of what is in the first phase of the programme, as well as a brief overview of what you need to do to successfully complete the first phase.

--INSERT SOME INSPIRATIONAL WORDS HERE==

## Phase 1 Requirements

You're probably here for the nitty gritty on how to pass phase 1. There is one main requirement to pass phase 1:

- [ ] Get 34,000XP on your MS Learn account

That's it. Yeah. Just sign up for [MS Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/), start doing some learning, and accumulate that much XP.

## Recommended Modules for Phase 2

If you're anything like us, there's a lot of things to choose from when you first hit the [MS Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) website ranging from the incredibly difficult and alien to things that might not necessarily be useful. We've decided to help out, and have compiled a list of modules that we think will be highly useful as foundational knowledge going into Phase 2:

<br>

- [ ] Developer Tools
  - [ ] [Git](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-to-github/) is a Version Control System (VCS) which is useful for collaborating with others, but also acts as a save system for developers to checkpoint their own progress (and to re-load from bad decisions and their consequences).

<br>

- [ ] Programming Languages
  - [ ] [Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/beginner-python/) is an incredibly useful scripting language used widely in the data science community, but is also useful for creating small pieces of supportive code
  - [ ] [C-Sharp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/csharp-first-steps/), also known as .NET, is a language that is widely used in the industry for a variety of applications from front-end web apps all the way to back-end APIs. It comes in many different varieties, but the core principles are the same.

<br>

- [ ] Web Development
  - [ ] [HTML & CSS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-simple-website/) are the backbone of any web-page. Knowing what these are and how they are structured is fundamental for doing any web development work.
  - [ ] [JavaScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/web-development-101/) is the fundamental language for running code on the browser. This is what is leveraged (usually) to create rich and seamless user interfaces and experiences on the web.
  - [ ] [TypeScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript/) is a must for any new web developer, and will save you from a lot of mistakes. It's useful because it adds safety to Javascript, making it less likely that you will accidentally make mistakes when programming.
    - [ ] **NOTE** - **ONLY THE FIRST 4 MODULES ARE ESPECIALLY USEFUL**
    - [ ] The remaining content is more advanced, and is unlikely to come up in our use-case for TS starting out. If you feel like you need additional knowledge, do go ahead and finish this learning path - we're not going to stop you :)
  - [ ] [React](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/react/) is a highly versatile view engine used to combine HTML, CSS and JS into one cohesive block (known as _components_). This makes web development much more streamlined and efficient when making changes to the UI.
        **NOTE** - **IGNORE THIS [PAGE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/react-states-events/4-events)**

<br>

- [ ] APIs
  - [ ] [RESTful APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-web-api-minimal-api/) are an implementation of API for accessing information and providing a service without needing to implement a UI. These are useful as they allow developers to perform operations that are quite complex without developing the solution themselves, thus saving time.
  - [ ] [Relational Databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-relational-data-offerings/) are a way to represent stored data, which can then later be used or returned. For example, when a user signs up for a site, that user's sign up information will likely be stored in one of these.

<br>

- [ ] AI/Machine Learning
  - [ ] [AI and Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/get-started-with-artificial-intelligence-on-azure/) are complex topics, and are hard to wrap your head around without a lot of pre-requisite knowledge. To help dip your toes in, we've linked in a module for helping explain the basics at a higher-level.

<br>

## Recommended Schedule

That's a LOT of modules - and we're sure that a lot of you are probably feeling quite overwhelmed right now (we definitely were when we did this). To help break this up into something more manageable, we have provided a recommended schedule for completing the modules, and their corresponding workshop tasks.

_You do not need to follow this schedule, provided that you meet the course requirements specified earlier._

## Recommended Tools

As you go through and do these modules, you'll find that you need quite a few tools to complete some of the workshops as well as the modules. To help facilitate this process of trying to get everything downloaded, we've compiled a list here:

- [ ] Required Tools
  - [ ] [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - [ ] [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [ ] [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - [ ] [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
  - [ ] [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [ ] Development Environments
  - [ ] [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) a lightweight IDE suitable for developing any language, with a bit of fine-tuning (I'd recommend googling on how to set it up for use)
  - [ ] [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) is an alternative IDE to Visual Studio (and, IMO, runs about a million times faster)
    - [ ] [Free License](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) for students
  - [ ] [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) the c# IDE
  - [ ] [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) is meant to be paid, but it doesn't lock you out of anything if your trial expires so **shhhh**. Makes managing and visualising git much easier

## Hot Tips

- Managing your time well is always good - it's enough content that trying to do it all in one week is going to be a struggle!
- Forking this repository is a good idea:
  - You can do that by clicking the fork button on this site in the upper right corner (see below)

- This is useful, because it will allow you to fill in the checklists on this page!

* [ ] This is an empty checklist item
  - [x] This is a completed checklist item! you can complete checklist items by opening up this README file in edit mode, and putting an **X** character between the open square brackets.
