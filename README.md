## Recommended Tools

As you go through and do these modules, you'll find that you need quite a few tools to complete some of the workshops as well as the modules. To help facilitate this process of trying to get everything downloaded, we've compiled a list here:

- [x] Required Tools
  - [x] [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - [x] [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [x] [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - [x] [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
  - [x] [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [x] Development Environments
  - [x] [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) a lightweight IDE suitable for developing any language, with a bit of fine-tuning (I'd recommend googling on how to set it up for use)
  - [ ] [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) is an alternative IDE to Visual Studio (and, IMO, runs about a million times faster)
    - [ ] [Free License](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) for students
  - [x] [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) the c# IDE
